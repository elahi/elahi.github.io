I am a lecturer at Stanford University's Hopkins Marine Station, where I teach courses in marine ecology, invertebrate zoology, and statistics. Here's my [**CV**](/cv/Elahi_CV_long_221110.pdf).

A list of the courses offered at Hopkins Marine Station can be found here:

<https://hopkinsmarinestation.stanford.edu/courses>

A bit more info on my upcoming courses can be found [here](https://elahi.github.io/teaching.html). These courses are taught in-person at Hopkins Marine Station.

As a lecturer, I do not take graduate students. Please have a look at the list of [professors at Hopkins](https://hopkinsmarinestation.stanford.edu/people/faculty) for PhD opportunities.

If you are a Stanford undergraduate student interested in doing ecological research at Hopkins Marine Station, please contact me.
