## Courses (2025)

### Between Pacific Tides: Invertebrate Zoology in Monterey Bay (OCEANS 161/261)

Invertebrates range in size from microscopic mites to giant squid and are integral to ecosystems and their functioning. More than 97% of all described animal species lack a spine, and this course is an introductory survey of invertebrate diversity with an emphasis on intertidal habitats of Monterey Bay. Students will explore the form, function, evolution, and natural history of the major invertebrate groups through reading, observation, and scientific illustration. This course takes place at Hopkins Marine Station, and consists of a one hour morning lecture and a three hour afternoon lab; both are mandatory. Students must attend the first meeting in person to guarantee their space in the course. Two field trips will be taken to local intertidal habitats.

Term: Winter \
F: 11:00-11:50; 1:30-4:20 \
Units: 4 \
UG reqs: WAY-SMA \

### Statistical Modeling (OCEANS 140/240)

Intermediate course focused on statistical modeling in a Bayesian framework, with applications in the biological and environmental sciences. Topics will include probability, generalized linear models, causal inference, and model comparison. We will take a hands-on, computational approach (R, Stan) to gain intuition so that students can later design their own inferential models. Prerequisites: Introductory statistics course, such as STATS 60, STATS 110, STATS 141 and some experience with scientific computing in R, such as STATS 32.

T, Th: 10:30-12:00 \
Units: 3 \


### Hopkins Marine Station Seminar (OCEANS 114)

Introduction to research in marine science through a weekly seminar series at Hopkins Marine Station (HMS) and the Oceans department on main campus. The weekly seminars will approach questions of development, physiology, ecology, evolution, and oceanography using contemporary methods. Speakers will alternate between HMS and main campus but the seminar will be live-streamed to the other campus. Student attendance is expected in-person at either campus. 

Term: Winter \
F: 12:00-1:00 \
Units: 1 \


### Environmental Change and Marine Biodiversity (OCEANS 125/225)

In this course we will study marine biodiversity and the impacts of environmental change on ocean life and marine ecosystems. Students will first study fundamental aspects of physiology, ecology, and evolution in marine animals and plants. Then, students will apply these principles to understand the consequences of environmental change on the functioning of organisms and ecosystems. Through field activities in the living laboratory of the Monterey coast, students will be immersed in the richness and complexity of marine food webs. Students will develop an integrative view of the past and future of ocean ecosystems, forming an evidence-based understanding of the consequences of recent anthropogenic influences on ocean biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. This course takes place at Hopkins Marine Station.

Term: Spring \
M: 9:30-12:20; 1:30-2:20 \
Units: 4 \
Co-taught with Jeremy Goldbogen \


### Kelp Forest Ecology (OCEANS 185/285)

This is an experiential field course on the ecology of giant kelp forests. Through daily scuba dives, lectures, and labs, students become acquainted with the common invertebrates, fishes, and seaweeds and how their interactions shape the community. The course has three major components: natural history, ecology, and research. The first portion of the course concentrates on how to recognize the common species, how to identify them if you don’t know who they are, and to learn where they can be found. Second, once students are familiar with the natural history of kelp forest inhabitants, we use that as a springboard to discuss population and community processes that affect both obvious and more subtle differences in patterns of distribution and abundance that can be seen in different kelp forests around the Monterey peninsula. Third, students will formulate and test a hypothesis related to the ecology of kelp forests. We will practice commonly used methods for quantifying the abundance and population structure for a variety of species. The data we collect during the course contribute to on-going time series for the Hopkins Marine Life Observatory, some of which have been conducted for nearly three decades. This course will be held in person at Hopkins Marine Station from 14 July to 14 August, 2025. Prerequisite(s): AAUS scientific diver certification; a course will be offered immediately prior to this class (23 June – 11 July 2025). 

Term: Summer \
Units: 3 \
UG reqs: WAY-SMA \

This is a 5-week course and we will meet 8am-5pm, Monday-Friday. You are also expected to work on assignments outside of class. In other words, this course is a full-time commitment. What is it like to be a student in this class? You can learn about the course from a [Stanford report](https://news.stanford.edu/report/2022/08/23/underwater-scientists-investigate-kelp-forests/?utm_source=Stanford+ALL&utm_campaign=48339550ec-int_COPY_02&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_c042b4aad7-48339550ec-55725232) and from previous students here: <https://purl.stanford.edu/km092my4610>

This course is open to non-Stanford students as well as post-bac students (i.e., if you have already graduated). You will apply and register through [Stanford Summer Session](https://summer.stanford.edu/). Students will provide, at minimum, their wetsuit, gloves, booties, hood, mask, snorkel, weight belt, and fins. Please reach out if you need a loaner BCD and regulator.

PRIORITY deadline: March 15 (you will be notified of admission by April 1)

FINAL deadline: April 15 (you will be notified of admission by May 1)

<!-- ### Introduction to Research in Ecology and Ecological Physiology (BIOHOPK 47, OCEANS 47) -->

<!-- This course is a field-based inquiry into rocky intertidal shores that introduces students to ecology and environmental physiology and the research methods used to study them. Students will learn how to detect patterns quantitatively in nature through appropriate sampling methods. Following exploration of appropriate background material in class and through exploration of the scientific literature, students will formulate testable hypotheses regarding the underlying causes of the patterns they discern. A variety of different aspects of ecology and physiology will be investigated cooperatively by the students during the quarter, culminating in development of an individual final paper in the form of a research proposal based on data collected during the course. The course will provide a broad conceptual introduction to the underlying biological principles that influence adaptation to dynamic habitats, as well as an inquiry-based experience in how to explore complex systems in nature. This course fulfills the same laboratory requirement as BIO 47. -->

<!-- ### Topics in Scientific and Statistical Computing (OCEANS 200) -->

<!-- In this course we will build community, foster discussion, and develop a deeper understanding of a single topic relevant to scientific or statistical programming using R. The specific format will be chosen by participants in the course; students are empowered to take the lead in the discussion of weekly readings. Prerequisites: an introductory course in statistics and some familiarity with the R programming language. Formerly BIOHOPK 200. -->

<!-- ### Experimental Design and Probability (OCEANS 174/274) -->

<!-- Nature is inherently variable. Statistics gives us the tools to quantify the uncertainty of our measurements and draw conclusions from data. This course is an introduction to experimental design, probability, and data analysis. Topics include summary statistics, data visualization, probability distributions, statistical inference, and general linear models (e.g., t-tests, analysis of variance, regression). Students will use R to explore and analyze datasets relevant to the life and ocean sciences. No programming or statistical background is assumed. This course takes place at Hopkins Marine Station, and consists of two morning lectures, and an afternoon computer lab. Formerly BIOHOPK174/274. -->
